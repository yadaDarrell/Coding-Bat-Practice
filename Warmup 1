Question 1: Sleep in
The parameter weekday is True if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is True if we are on vacation. 
We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return True if we sleep in.

Expected Result:
sleep_in(False, False) → True
sleep_in(True, False) → False
sleep_in(False, True) → True

#1 Solution
if not weekday or vacation:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
Question 2: Monkey Trouble
We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling. 
We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return True if we are in trouble.

Expected Result:
monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False

#2 Solution
def monkey_trouble(a_smile, b_smile):
  if a_smile and b_smile or not a_smile and not b_smile:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
Question 3: Sum Double
Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum.

Expected Result:
sum_double(1, 2) → 3
sum_double(3, 2) → 5
sum_double(2, 2) → 8

#3 Solution
def sum_double(a, b):
  if a == b:
    return 2 * (a+b)
  else:
    return a + b
    
Question 4: Diff 21
Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.

Expected Result:
diff21(19) → 2
diff21(10) → 11
diff21(21) → 0

#4 Solution 
def diff21(n):
  if n>21:
    return 2*(n-21)
  else:
    return 21-n
    
Question 5: Parrot Trouble
We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0...23. 
We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return True if we are in trouble.

Expected Result
parrot_trouble(True, 6) → True
parrot_trouble(True, 7) → False
parrot_trouble(False, 6) → False

#5 Solution
def parrot_trouble(talking, hour):
  while talking:
    if hour < 7 or hour>20:
      return True
    else:
      return False
  else:
    return False
    
Question 6: Makes 10
Given 2 ints, a and b, return True if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.

Expected Result:
makes10(9, 10) → True
makes10(9, 9) → False
makes10(1, 9) → True

#6 Solution 
def makes10(a, b):
  if a == 10 or b == 10 or a + b == 10:
    return True
  else:
    return False
